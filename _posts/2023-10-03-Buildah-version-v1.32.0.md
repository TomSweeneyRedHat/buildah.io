We are shipping this release on Fedora 38 and Fedora 39.  Buildah will also be shipped on CentOS, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu soon.  In addition, container images will be available at https://quay.io/repository/buildah/stable and https://quay.io/repository/containers/buildah.

The Buildah project has continued to grow over the past several weeks, welcoming several new contributors to the mix.  This release features notable enhancements:
