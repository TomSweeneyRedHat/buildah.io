# Buildah version 1.30.0 Release Announcement

We're pleased to announce the release of [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah) [version 1.30.0](https://github.com/containers/buildah/releases/tag/v1.30.0), which is now available from GitHub for any Linux distro.  We are shipping this release on Fedora 37, Fedora 38, and Fedora 39.  Buildah will also be shipped on CentOS, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu soon.  In addition, container images will be available at https://quay.io/repository/buildah/stable and https://quay.io/repository/containers/buildah.

The Buildah project has continued to grow over the past several weeks, welcoming several new contributors to the mix.  This release features notable enhancements: 
<!--readmore -->
 * The login command now supports interspersed args
 * The `--network` option is now handled by `RUN` commands in Containerfiles.
 * The `ARG` command in a Containerfile will now honor any value passed, and environment variables work more intuitively in Containerfiles.

This release comprises changes made for v1.29.1 and v1.30.0 and will be included in Podman v4.5.

## Release Changes

### Changes for v1.30.0
   * Added a new CleanCacheMount API which allows cleaning of the buildcache generated on the host. [#4552](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4552)
   * The `login` command now supports interspersed args for password from stdin.  I.e. `$ cat password.txt | buildah login docker.io -u user --password-stdin` [#4558](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4558)
   * Changes to cleanup routines ensure that orphaned stages and dangling containers are now appropriately removed. [#4595](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4595)
   * `buildah build` should no longer produce spurious "Pushing cache []:..." messages while building images.[#4602](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4602/)
   * OCI images produced using multi-stage builds, where the final stage is based on an earlier stage, will no longer include an "org.opencontainers.image.base.name" annotation for the base of that earlier stage combined with an "org.opencontainers.image.base.digest" annotation which corresponds to the image produced by that earlier stage, which are two different images. [#4618](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4618)
   * Then ExtendedAgent now supports signing with flags as BuildKit does. [#4637](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4637/)
   * The `COPY` command in a Containerfile will now honor any ARG value [#4578](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4578)
   * Buildah no longer warns about unused TARGETARCH,TARGETOS,TARGETPLATFORM variables [#4634](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4634)
   * Buildah container images now will inform users the list of capabilities they require, including CAP_SYS_CHROOT. [#4643](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4643)
   * The "ifnewer" option has been added to the help message for the `pull1` command.  The option had been added to the command prior. [#4645](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4645)
   * Buildah now only attempts to push the cache during a build only when the cacheKey is generated. [#4650](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4650)
   * Support has been added for inline `--network` options in Containerfile `RUN` statements. [#4566](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4566)
   * The `build` command now prints a 12-digit hash instead of an 11-digit hash upon successful completion. [#4660](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4660)
   * A fresh sysfs is now mounted when the netns is private [#4684](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4684/)
   * The `--build-arg-file {your-args}` option in a Containerfile now allows specifying `--build-args` from a file instead of inline in the build command. [#4686](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4686/)
   * Buildah now only applies a label on the final image during the build instead of all intermediate images[#4673](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4673/)
   * The `RUN --network=default` command in a Containerfile is now ignored as it is in BuildKit. [#4659](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4659)
   * Process environment variables as passed by reference.  The `buildah run --env` command will now lookup environment variables.  Also, if `--env A` is passed and `A` is not defined, `A` will now remain unset rather than being set to blank. [#4702](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/4702)
