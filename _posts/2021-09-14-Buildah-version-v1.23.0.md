# Buildah version 1.23.0 Release Announcement

We're pleased to announce the release of [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah) [version 1.23.0](https://github.com/containers/buildah/releases/tag/v1.23.0), which is now available from GitHub for any Linux distro.  We are shipping this release on Fedora 34 & 35, and RHEL 8.5.  Buildah will also be shipped on CentOS, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu soon.  In addition, container images will be available at https://quay.io/repository/buildah/stable and https://quay.io/repository/containers/buildah.

The Buildah project has continued to grow over the past several weeks, welcoming several new contributors to the mix.  This release features notable enhancements: 
<!--readmore -->
 * Support has been added for rootless containers to use overlay mounts.
 * An epoch time field has been added to the container images created by Buildah.
 * The `bud` command has been renamed to `build`.  An alias for `bud` was created for backward compatibility and to not break existing scripts.
 * The `platform` option for `build` can now take multiple values.
 * The `login` and `logout` commands now accept repositories as Podman does.

This release comprises changes made for v1.23.0 and will be included in Podman v3.3.1

## Release Changes

### Changes for v1.23.0
  *  Added support for rootless containers to use overlay mounts.
  *  The `build` command now mirrors the value provided to the `--authfile` option to a temporary file on the filesystem if it is pointing to a file descriptor instead of a file.
  *  The  `rm <list>` option of the `build` command has been corrected to only remove manifests rather than referenced images.
  *  Improvements have been made to the performance of `--compress=false` of the build command.
  *  Fixed an issue when tagging a manifest list.  It would at times tag an image instead of the manifest.
  *  Add support for libsubid which will allow remote access to /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid information from LDAP services when shadow-utils is shipped with libsuid.
  *  Added an epoch time field to buildah images.
  *  Fix ownership of the /home/build/.local/share/containers directory in the Containerfiles that build the images on quay.io.

  *  Fixed a possible timing issue with the stage processing of the build command.
  *  Support has been added for SSH mounts in the `buildah run` command.
  *  Fixed a DNS resolution issue when using the `--net=private` option with `buildah run`.
  *  Fixed a nil dereference in `buildah run` command logger option.
  *  The `--platform` option to `buildah bud` can now take a comma-separated list or be specified multiple times, for use in combination with the `--manifest` option.
  *  Set the new annotations for the fqdn and digest of the base image.
