# Buildah version 1.33.0 Release Announcement

We're pleased to announce the release of [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah) [version 1.33.0](https://github.com/containers/buildah/releases/tag/v1.33.0), which is now available from GitHub for any Linux distro.  We are shipping this release on Fedora 38 and Fedora 39.  Buildah will also be shipped on CentOS, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu soon.  In addition, container images will be available at https://quay.io/repository/buildah/stable and https://quay.io/repository/containers/buildah.

The Buildah project has continued to grow over the past several weeks, welcoming several new contributors to the mix.  This release features notable enhancements: 
<!--readmore -->
 * Heredoc syntax is now supported for the `RUN`, `COPY` and `ADD` commands in a Containerfile.
 * Added support for --unsetlabel in the `build` and `config` commands.
 * The `build` command now has a `--no-hostname` option which prevents the container’s `/etc/hostname` file from being populated.
 * The `login` and `logout` commands now support editing Docker-compatible config files, using a `--compat-auth-file`.
 * The `ADD` command in a Containerfile now supports the --checksum flag for HTTP sources
This release comprises changes made for v1.33.0 and will be included in Podman v4.5.

## Release Changes

### Changes for v1.33.0
   * Tag a v1.32.0 release by [@nalind](https:/github.com/nalind) in [#5046](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5046)
   * The buildah add` and `buildah copy` commands should correctly handle relative path names for sources when the `--context-directory` flag is used by [@nalind](https:/github.com/nalind) in [#5050](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5050)
   * Removing selinux_tag.sh as it is no longer needed after [#580356f](https://github.com/containers/buildah/commit/580356f) by [@rahilarious](https:/github.com/rahilarious) in [#5054](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5054)
   * When the base is `scratch`, build an image without layers by [@flouthoc](https:/github.com/flouthoc) in [#5031](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5031)
   * Add support for --unsetlabel in the `build` and `config` commands by [@flouthoc](https:/github.com/flouthoc) in [#5062](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5062)
   * Consider the `.ignorefile` with --build-context by [@danishprakash](https:/github.com/danishprakash) in 
[#5021](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5021)
   * Previously, when mounting multiple mounts, if any mount had a type specified, it would override the default type for subsequent mounts.  This corrects it, by [@BenjaminSchubert](https:/github.com/BenjaminSchubert) in [#5067](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5067)
   * run: use internal.GetTempDir instead of os.MkdirTemp by [@flouthoc](https:/github.com/flouthoc) in [#5084](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5084)
   * Do not remove base-image in a multi-stage build when built without `--layers` by [@flouthoc](https:/github.com/flouthoc) in [#5081](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5081)
   * The `build` command now has a `--no-hostname` option which prevents the container’s `/etc/hostname` file from being populated by [@rhatdan](https:/github.com/rhatdan) in [#5094](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5094)
   * When a build that uses multiple --platform flags fails, the error message will indicate which platform experienced the failure by [@nalind](https:/github.com/nalind) in [#5112](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5112)
   * TEE types used with `buildah build --cw` and `buildah mkcw` are no longer required to be specified in lower-case by [@nalind](https:/github.com/nalind) in [#5159](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5159)
   *  The `login` and `logout` commands now support editing Docker-compatible config files, using a `--compat-auth-file` option by [@mtrmac](https:/github.com/mtrmac) in [#5143](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5143)
   * The `buildah build` command using a Containerfile with no instructions, with either `--unsetenv` or `--unsetlabel` specified on the command line, now correctly generates a new image by [@nalind](https:/github.com/nalind) in [#5160](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5160)
   * The `ADD` command in a Containerfile now supports the --checksum flag for HTTP sources by [@jfroy](https:/github.com/jfroy) in [#5152](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5152)
   * The value put into DefaultNetworkSysctl is no longer hard coded and now pulls the value from the containers.conf file by [@rhatdan](https:/github.com/rhatdan) in [#5156](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5156)
   * Heredoc syntax is now supported for the `RUN`, `COPY` and `ADD` commands in a Containerfile by [@flouthoc](https:/github.com/flouthoc) in [#5092](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5092)
   * The `buildah commit` command now accepts optional `--change` and `--config` options, which can be used to make last-minute changes to the configuration of an image when it is committed, by [@nalind](https:/github.com/nalind) in [#5150](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5150)
   *  The `buildah build` command will no longer produce an empty image when the `--cw` option is used along with the `--layers` option and the final instruction in the Dockerfile is not an `ADD`, `COPY`, or `RUN` command by [@nalind](https:/github.com/nalind) in [#5161](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/5161)

### Overall Miscellaneous Changes
