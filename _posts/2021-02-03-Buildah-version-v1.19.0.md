# Buildah version 1.19.0 Release Announcement

We're pleased to announce the release of [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah) [version 1.19.0](https://github.com/containers/buildah/releases/tag/v1.19.0), which is now available from GitHub for any Linux distro.  We are shipping this release on Fedora 32 & 33 and RHEL 8.4.  Buildah will also be shipped on CentOS, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu soon.  In addition, container images will be available at https://quay.io/repository/buildah/stable and https://quay.io/repository/containers/buildah.

The Buildah project has continued to grow over the past several weeks, welcoming several new contributors to the mix.  This release features the notable enhancements: The `--stdin` and `--from` options have been added to the `bud` command, further support for multi-arch images were added to the `bud` and `commit` commands, container image short name aliasing is now enabled by default, a few speed improvements to the build process, and a number of bug fixes.

  * When using the `bud` command, users can now employ the `--stdin` option to feed input into the build process.  See the `buildah bud` man page for details.
  * A new `--from` option has been added to the bud command.  When used, the value in the first FROM declaration in the Containerfile is overridden by the argument passed to the `--from` option.  See the `buildah bud` man page for details.
  * Added support to the ‘bud` and the `commit` commands for the  `--manifest` option to allow the building of multi-arch images.  See the `buildah bud` and `buildah commit` man pages for details.
  * Short-name aliasing has been enabled by default when running Buildah in a terminal. When pulling an image by a short name, Buildah may now present a prompt to choose which image to pull. Please refer to a recent [blog post](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/container-image-short-names) for details.

This release comprises changes made for v1.18.0 through v1.19.0.

## Release Changes

### Changes for v1.19.0
  * The `buildah inspect` command can now inspect manifests.
  * The `buildah push` command can now push manifests lists and digests.
  * Fixed handling of TMPDIR environment variable to now work as designed.
  * Added support to the ‘bud` and the `commit1 commands for the  `--manifest` option to allow the building of multi-arch images.  See the `buildah bud` and `buildah commit` man pages for details.
  * When mounting over a destination directory in a container, the mode is now preserved on the destination directory.
  * Enabled the `--arch` and `--os` options to be used in place of the `--override-os` and `override-arch` options to select architecture and os.  The `--override-os` and `override-arch` options are still usable but are deprecated and no longer listed in the man pages.
  * Attempting to ADD device nodes to a working container when running as an unprivileged user in rootless mode will now quietly ignore the device nodes and appear to succeed again, matching the behavior of versions before 1.16, instead of triggering an error.
  * The `buildah rmi --prune` now works as expected.
  * When using the `bud` command, users can now employ the `--stdin` option to feed input into the build process.  See the `buildah bud` man page for details.
  * A spurious error log message on failure to mount on /sys file systems when running rootless has been changed to an info log.
  * Switched references of the /var/run directory to the /run directory.  The /var/run directory is a legacy directory that has been replaced by the /run directory.  In some environments, warnings were raised due to the use of the /var/run directory.
  * A new `--from` option has been added to the bud command.  When used, the value in the first FROM declaration in the Containerfile is overridden by the argument passed to the `--from` option.  See the `buildah bud` man page for details.
  * Several changes to the copier code were made to handle replacing directories with non-directories and a few efficiency changes.
  * Added the `U` volume flag to chown source volumes within the container.
  * Rootless operations now use the correct isolation, “rootless”, instead of “oci”. 
  * Enable short-name aliasing of container images by default.
  * When calling the `manifest create` or `manifest add` commands, the registry is now checked before the local images.
  * Added further container information to the `.containerenv` file.
  * Added the `--ignorefile` and `--contextdir` options to the `add`, `bud`, and `create` commands.  Using these two options allows for an alternative location of the context directory and the `.dockerignore` file.
  * Fixed a crash on invalid filter commands.
  * A few shebangs in some of the scripts and examples were non-portable and have been corrected.
  * RUN instructions in builds will no longer run attached to a pseudo-terminal unless the `--stdin` flag is added.
  * The diffID for a mapped-layer is now computed when creating the image source to avoid a failure during container creation.
  * Bump to v1.19.0-dev
 
### Overall Miscellaneous Changes  
* Documentation:
  * Updated installation doc to reflect current status.
  * Updated docs for debian testing and unstable.
  * Removed copy/paste errors that leaked `Podman` into man pages.

* Vendored:
  * Vendor in github.com/containers/storage  v1.24.5.
  * Vendor in github.com/containers/common v0.33.0.
  * Vendor in github.com/opencontainers/selinux v1.8.0.
  * Vendor in github.com/onsi/gomega v1.10.4.

* Tests:
  * Test: ensure a non-directory in a Dockerfile path is handled correctly.
  * Moved away from using docker.io in the CI tests.
  * Turn off PRIOR_UBUNTU Test until the VM is updated.
  * pkg/supplemented test: replace our null blobinfocache

* Changes to the build infrastructure:
  * Cirrus: Track libseccomp and golang version.
  * Update nix pin with `make nixpkgs`.
  * Added a source debug build.
  * Add suggests cpp to the buildah.spec file.
  * SELinux no longer requires a tag in the Makefile.

* Plus a number of smaller fixes.
