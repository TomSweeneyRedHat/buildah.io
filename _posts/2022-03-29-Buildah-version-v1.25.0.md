# Buildah version 1.25.0 Release Announcement

We're pleased to announce the release of [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah) [version 1.25.0](https://github.com/containers/buildah/releases/tag/v1.25.0), which is now available from GitHub for any Linux distro.  We are shipping this release on Fedora 34, and Fedora 35.  Buildah will also be shipped on CentOS, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu soon.  In addition, container images will be available at https://quay.io/repository/buildah/stable and https://quay.io/repository/containers/buildah.

The Buildah project has continued to grow over the past several weeks, welcoming several new contributors to the mix.  This release features notable enhancements: 
<!--readmore -->
 * A container will now wait up to four minutes, up from 5 seconds, when it is created before it will fail due to network issues.
 * A `--no-hosts` option was added to the `build` and `run` commands.  
 * A new global option, `--cgroup-manager`, has been added.

This release comprises changes made for v1.24.1, v1.24.2, and v1.25.0 and will be included in Podman v4.1.

## Release Changes

### Changes for v1.25.0
   * A container will now wait up to four minutes, up from 5 seconds, when it is created before it will fail due to network issues.
   * A fix for CVE-2022-27651 addressed an issue with inheritable capabilities within the container.
   * The `--mount=type=cache` option now supports locking the external cache store.
   * A `--no-hosts` option was added to the `build` and `run` commands.  When used, an `/etc/host` file is not created within the container or container image by default.
   * Processing was added to the `add` command to ensure the context directory is an absolute path.
   * During a build, if the base image has a healthconfig and the child image does not, the healthconfig is inherited from the base image.  This emulates the processing that Docker does.
   * The buildah container images on quay.io now contain cpp.
   * The subuid/subgid values in buildah container images on quay.io have been increased to 65535.

   * Proxy variables are now only added to the container image’s history only if they are specified with the `ARG` command in the Containerfile.  This emulates Docker’s behavior.
   * A new option, `--cgroup-manager`, has been added that allows the cgroup manager to be overridden.  More information on the Buildah(1) man page.
   * When the `--cgroup-manager` is set to systemd, the `--systemd-cgroup` option for the OCI runtime is used, which is understood by both runc and crun.
   * A build would fail if a `RUN` command was specified in a Containerfile after a `Volume` command.  This [issue](https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues/3281) has been addressed.
   * An [issue](https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues/3755) with the `run` command’s `--cap-add=all` option not appropriately setting the capabilities has been corrected.
   * Support has been added for the `FROM` command in a Containerfile to allow specification of the OS, ARCH, or VARIANT values.  See the `--platform` option on the buildah-build (1) man page for more details.

### Overall Miscellaneous Changes  
* Documentation:
   * The source files for the Containerfile and containeringore man pages have moved to the containers/common project.
   * The options for commands in the man pages are now sorted alphabetically.

   * Removed a number of skips for rootless users.
   * Now unshares mount/umount if test is_rootless.
   * The copy tests now read the correct containers.conf and initialize the network.
   * Tests for rootless, which need unshare.
   * Added a test to protect against CVE-2022-27651 in the future.
   * The integration tests now run in a rootless environment.
   * An issue between TESTDIR and TESTSDIR in the test environment was fixed.
   * The combination-namespaces test has been sped up.
   * Tests now print a full pathname for files to output.

* Changes to the build infrastructure:
